To all our cherished supporters,

The advancements in digital technology have enabled people to connect with the world and share common joys. This has created a space where diverse perspectives and opinions intersect, fostering an environment that respects diversity.

At NoriPro, we embrace this diversity and aspire to nurture cultures that many people genuinely love. To achieve this, it is essential that we respect and understand each other's differences, which is why we have established the "NoriPro Fandom Action Guidelines."

The purpose of these guidelines is to wholeheartedly support your *Oshi* (beloved talents) while respecting diversity and providing an environment for collective growth.

## 1. Support Them
Please support your *Oshi* wholeheartedly. NoriPro welcomes support in various forms. However, please refrain from attempting to control your *Oshi*' life or choices.

## 2. Watch Over Them
Your Oshis are growing every day, and there may be failures along the way, but that's all part of the journey. Let's watch over and cheer for each unique journey.

## 3. Respecting Them
Please respect your *Oshi*'s personality, privacy, opinions, and values. Avoid insulting or leaving offensive comments when comparing them to other fans or others' *Oshi*.

## 4. Coexistence within the Community
In the community, please strive to respect each other. Even when differences of opinion or conflicts arise, try to resolve them through dialogue and understanding, without adopting an aggressive attitude.

## 5. Transparency
Please refrain from spreading false information or misinformation. We ask everyone to prioritize the truth and act based on accurate information.

The "NoriPro Fan Support Guidelines" are meant to create an environment where everyone can support their *Oshi* comfortably, healthily, and joyfully. I believe that, by adhering to these guidelines, we can build a wonderful community together.

President of NoriPro, Norio Tsukudani
